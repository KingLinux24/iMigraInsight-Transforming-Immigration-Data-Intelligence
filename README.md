# iMigraInsight: Revolutionizing Immigration Data Intelligence

## Introduction

Welcome to iMigraInsight, where we embark on a journey to revolutionize immigration data intelligence. Our project is driven by the vision of a more efficient and compassionate approach to collecting immigration data using advanced data science and artificial intelligence. With a focus on enhancing national security, protecting human rights, and informing data-driven policy development, iMigraInsight aims to address the pressing challenges of modern immigration. Join us as we navigate the complexities of immigration with innovation, empathy, and a commitment to making a positive impact.

## Built With

- Python
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, matplotlib, plotly
- Jupyter Notebook
- Linux ONE
- tabula (for PDF data extraction)

## Data Sources

Our project collects and analyzes data from various sources, including:
- Government Immigration Agencies (e.g., USCIS, DHS)
- United Nations (UN)
- World Bank
- Migration Policy Institute
- Pew Research Center
- National Statistical Offices
- Academic Databases
- Data.gov (U.S.)
- International Organizations (e.g., IOM, UNHCR)

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Machine learning model creation
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation for model consistency
- Data visualization with interactive charts and heatmaps

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Python environment with the required libraries.
3. Load your data from various sources.
4. Train and evaluate your machine learning model.
5. Visualize the data using interactive charts.
6. Save and load your model for predictions.

## Usage
